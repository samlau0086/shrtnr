# Changelog

All notable changes to the SDK are documented in this file.

## 1.2.0 (2026-09-10)

Restores a request header the 1.0 rewrite dropped, and turns one crash into the documented error. No public surface changes.

- **`X-Client: sdk` is sent again on every request.** The API reads this header to record how a link or bundle was created, setting `created_via` to `sdk` when it is present and `api` otherwise. 1.0 removed it deliberately, as this changelog records, which left every link and bundle created through this SDK recording as `api` while the admin detail pages showed that value as if it were meaningful. Every resource routes through one header builder, so the sync and async clients both carry it. Callers who read `created_via` should expect `sdk` again for their own writes.
- **A 2xx body of literal `null` raises `ShrtnrError` instead of `AttributeError`.** A non-204 response carrying `null` is four bytes of valid JSON, so it cleared both the empty-body guard and the parse guard and reached `SomeModel.from_dict(None)`, which failed with a bare `AttributeError`. `parse_json_response` now raises `ShrtnrError`, matching the documented failure mode and the empty-body fix from 1.1.2. The check is scoped to `None`, so the legitimate array bodies that `list()` returns are unaffected.
- **The 1.0.0 entry's constructor note is corrected.** It claimed the positional `base_url` argument became keyword-only, and its example implied `Shrtnr("https://...", api_key=...)` stopped working. Neither was true: the 0.1.0 constructor already bound `base_url` as positional-or-keyword with `api_key` keyword-only, exactly as the code does today, so that call shape has always worked. The entry omitted the constructor change that did happen, renaming `client` to `http_client`, which is recorded there now. No signature changed in this release.
- Records the spec hash for app 0.39.0. Paths and schemas are unchanged; only `info.version` moved.

## 1.1.3 (2026-08-27)

Transport fix. No public surface changes.

- The owned `httpx.Client` and `httpx.AsyncClient` follow redirects. httpx defaults to `follow_redirects=False`, while the TypeScript SDK (`fetch`, default `"follow"`) and the Dart SDK (`http.Client`) both follow a 3xx from a deployment's front door transparently, so the same `base_url` behaved differently depending on which SDK made the request. A caller-supplied `http_client` keeps its own setting.
- Records the spec hash for app 0.38.0. Paths and schemas are unchanged; only `info.version` moved.

## 1.1.2 (2026-08-10)

Error-handling fix. No public surface changes.

- An empty body served with a non-204 2xx raises `ShrtnrError(status, "Empty response body")`. This is the same "truncated body served with a 200" case the invalid-JSON guard covers, for instance a proxy that strips the body off some 2xx responses. Returning `None` only deferred the failure to the resource method's `SomeModel.from_dict(...)`, which reported it as a bare `AttributeError` and slipped past `except ShrtnrError` handling. A 204 still returns `None`. The Dart SDK carries the same fix in 2.1.2; TypeScript reaches the same outcome through its JSON-parse guard.
- Documentation: the `Key types` list names the types added since it was written (`BundleTopLink`, `DateCount`, `SlugCount`, `BreakdownDimension`, `BreakdownPage`).
- Records the spec hash for app 0.37.1. Paths and schemas are unchanged; only `info.version` moved.

## 1.1.1 (2026-07-28)

- A 2xx response whose body is not valid JSON now raises `ShrtnrError(status)`. Previously `response.json()` raised a bare `JSONDecodeError`, so an HTML error page or a truncated body served with a 200 escaped the SDK's error type. The TypeScript and Dart SDKs carry the same fix in 1.1.1 and 2.1.1.
- `links.qr()` now takes `size` as an `int` instead of a `str`, matching the API schema (which validates an integer) and the TypeScript and Dart SDKs. Callers who passed an int already got the correct behavior; the annotation was the only thing out of step.

## 1.1.0 (2026-06-19)

- Add `links.breakdown` and `bundles.breakdown` (sync and async) for paging through the countries, sources and domains analytics panels (offset/limit, returns items + total).

## 1.0.2 (2026-05-07)

- `links.update()` and `bundles.update()` can now distinguish "omit this field" from "set this field to null". Optional nullable params (`label`, `expires_at`, `description`, `icon`) default to a private `UNSET` sentinel; only keys explicitly provided by the caller are included in the request body. Pass `None` to clear a value, omit the param to leave the server-side value untouched. Sync and async resources both updated; regression tests cover both clients.

## 1.0.1 (2026-04-30)

Packaging, documentation, and CI hygiene. No public surface changes.

- Ship `NOTICE` and `TRADEMARK_POLICY.md` in the wheel and sdist alongside the existing `LICENSE`. Consumers running license scanners now see Oddbit's trademark policy without having to clone the repo.
- README polish: dropped the "Migrating from 0.x" section and replaced "License" with an "Attribution" section that points at the same files.
- Internal: tightened return-type annotations on resource list methods so `mypy --strict` passes; aligned the e2e test fixture loop scope with `pytest-asyncio`'s current default; cleared the remaining `ruff` warnings so CI runs clean. None of these change runtime behavior.

## 1.0.0 (2026-04-29)

Ground-up rewrite derived from the OpenAPI spec. This is a deliberate breaking release.

### Breaking changes

**Resource-grouped client.** All methods now live under `client.links`, `client.slugs`, or
`client.bundles`. Flat methods on the top-level client are gone.

```python
# 0.x
client.create_link(CreateLinkOptions(url="..."))
client.archive_bundle(42)

# 1.0
client.links.create(url="...")
client.bundles.archive(42)
```

**Constructor shape.** The `client` parameter is renamed `http_client`. Parameter binding carries
over from 0.x unchanged: `base_url` is positional-or-keyword, and `api_key`, `timeout` and
`http_client` are keyword-only. The keyword form of `base_url` is the documented style throughout
the README, but the positional form is accepted.

```python
# 0.x
Shrtnr("https://s.example.com", api_key="sk_...", client=my_httpx_client)

# 1.0
Shrtnr(base_url="https://s.example.com", api_key="sk_...", http_client=my_httpx_client)
```

**`ShrtnrError` shape.** The `body` field is removed. Use `server_message` (the `error` string
from the JSON response). The `str()` representation formats as
`"shrtnr API error (HTTP {status}): {server_message}"`.

**Result types.** `delete`, `add_link`, and `remove_link` return typed dataclasses
(`DeletedResult`, `AddedResult`, `RemovedResult`) instead of bare `bool`. Access
`.deleted`, `.added`, or `.removed`.

**`ClickStats` expanded.** New fields from the spec: `referrer_hosts`, `link_modes`, `channels`,
`num_countries`, `num_referrers`, `num_referrer_hosts`, `num_os`, `num_browsers`.

**`Link` gains `delta_pct?`:** click count change percentage versus the previous period.

**`BundleWithSummary` is flat.** Fields are directly on the object instead of nested under a
`bundle` attribute.

**`bundles.list` `archived` parameter** is now the raw spec enum string (`"all"`, `"only"`,
`"1"`, `"true"`) instead of a Python `bool`.

**`health()` removed.** The `/_/health` endpoint is outside the public API spec.

**`X-Client: sdk` header removed.** The 1.0 HTTP layer sends only `Authorization: Bearer ...`.

### New surface

- `client.links`: `get`, `list`, `create`, `update`, `disable`, `enable`, `delete`,
  `analytics`, `timeline`, `qr`, `bundles`
- `client.slugs`: `lookup`, `add`, `disable`, `enable`, `remove`
- `client.bundles`: `get`, `list`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, `archive`, `unarchive`,
  `analytics`, `links`, `add_link`, `remove_link`
- `AsyncShrtnr` mirrors all methods with `async/await`.

See the README for the full method table and migration guide.

### 1.0 post-release fixes (SDK review)

**`Bundle.accent` is now required at parse time.** `Bundle.from_dict` and
`BundleWithSummary.from_dict` previously used `data.get("accent", "orange")`,
masking a missing field. They now use `data["accent"]`, raising `KeyError` if the
field is absent so the problem surfaces immediately.

**`bundles.list(archived=...)` tightened to `Literal["true","1","only","all"]`**
(was `str`), matching the TypeScript union type and completing cross-SDK parity.

**Model names confirmed canonical.** `DateCount`, `SlugCount`, `BundleTopLink`,
`DeletedResult`, `AddedResult`, `RemovedResult` are the reference names adopted by
all three SDKs.

## 0.2.0

- `get_link_analytics(link_id, *, range=...)` accepts an optional `TimelineRange` keyword.
  Defaults to all-time when omitted.
- `get_bundle_analytics(bundle_id, *, range=...)` default changed from `"30d"` to `"all"`.

## 0.1.0

First release of the Python SDK. Method-for-method parity with the TypeScript SDK.

- Sync `Shrtnr` client built on `httpx.Client` and async `AsyncShrtnr` client built on
  `httpx.AsyncClient`.
- Full link lifecycle: create, list, get, update, disable, enable, delete, list by owner.
- Slug management: add, disable, enable, remove, lookup by slug.
- Click analytics, QR code SVG, and service health check.
- Bundles: create, list, get, update, delete, archive, unarchive, analytics, membership
  management, reverse lookup.
- Bearer-token auth matching the TypeScript SDK, plus `X-Client: sdk` header.
- Typed with frozen dataclasses and `Literal` types; `py.typed` marker ships in the wheel.
- Works on Python 3.9 and later.

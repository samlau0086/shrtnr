# Changelog

## 0.39.0 (2026-09-10)

Feature and defect release (PRs #56 through #58, plus the local sign-in and browser-suite work landed directly on `main`). Local development gets a sign-in of its own, and the admin pages get a suite that clicks them in a real browser. The release also closes an open redirect, a D1 parameter-cap crash, and two buttons that failed silently.

- **Local development has a per-browser sign-in.** Cloudflare Access fronts the admin pages in production, so the worker never carried a login of its own, and `DEV_IDENTITY` in `.dev.vars` gave the whole server one identity that a browser could not change. `/_/dev/login?as=<id>` now sets a `dev_identity` cookie (HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax, no Secure, since local dev runs plain http) and redirects to a same-origin `to` path or the dashboard. Without `as` it renders a form, and `/_/dev/logout` clears the cookie. `extractIdentity`, `verifyAccessJwt` and `isSignedIn` read it in dev mode after a JWT or the Access email header and ahead of `DEV_IDENTITY`. Both routes answer 404 whenever `ACCESS_AUD` is set, and every identity read ignores the cookie in that mode, so a deployment exposes nothing. `.dev.vars.example` carries the recipe for a fresh clone.
- **A Playwright suite drives the admin pages in a real browser.** The vitest suite proves the server emits the right HTML, JSON and SQL. Nothing opened a page and clicked, so a dead control, a script throwing on load, or a link that 500s under real data could pass review and reach a release. `yarn e2e` boots `wrangler dev` on a throwaway D1 under `.wrangler/e2e-state`, never the developer's own database, signs in through `/_/dev/login`, and seeds a catalog of known shape: 60 links, 2 disabled, 3 clicked. The links spec exercises every filter chip, both sorts, next and previous, a direct page, the per-page selector, a page past the end, and search hit and miss. Each step asserts the URL the click produced and the state the page marks current. The smoke spec loads every admin page with a clean console and fetches every same-origin link it renders, so a control leading nowhere fails even on a page no spec targets yet. CI runs the suite on every push and pull request.
- **Open redirect closed in the dev sign-in.** `safeReturnPath()` rejected a `to=` value starting with `//` or `/\`, but it read the raw string. Browsers strip embedded TAB, CR and LF before parsing a URL, so `/\t/evil.example` cleared the same-origin check and then collapsed to the scheme-relative `//evil.example` once the browser followed the redirect, handing a signed-in session to an attacker-chosen origin. The check now strips those characters before validating, so it sees the path the browser will resolve. Both dev routes 404 whenever `ACCESS_AUD` is set, so the exposure covered local and misconfigured deployments.
- **Per-link analytics no longer fails past 99 slugs on one link.** D1 caps a prepared statement at 100 bound parameters. `getStats`, `getTimeline`, `getLinkBreakdown`, `getLinkBreakdownPage` and `compareLinkStats` each bound one parameter per slug, so a link carrying more than 99 failed every one of its analytics queries with `SQLITE_ERROR: too many SQL variables`. A `linkSlugScope()` subquery now resolves slug membership inside SQLite from the link id, holding the bind count at one whatever the slug count. 0.37.1 applied the same technique to bundles and missed the per-link case.
- **The two most common create buttons report their failures.** `quickShorten`, `createLink` and `createDuplicate` parsed the error body with no fallback, so a response carrying no JSON (an edge 502, a bare 500) rejected the promise unhandled and left the button looking inert. 0.37.1 added this fallback to fourteen other handlers and missed these three. The regression guard that should have caught them matched `res.json().then(` and `toast(` on a single source line, which these three span, so it now scans with balanced parentheses.
- **MCP `add_link_to_bundle` drops an ownership claim it does not enforce.** The description said only the bundle owner can add, while `addLinkToBundle()` stays open to any authenticated caller by design. An agent trusting the text could add another user's link while believing the call was caller-scoped.
- Root app dependencies, the TypeScript SDK's dev dependencies and the Python SDK's dev dependency floors move to their latest versions. CI's `actions/upload-artifact` moves to v7.
- OpenAPI paths and schemas are unchanged from 0.38.0; only `info.version` changes. The bump refreshes the recorded spec hash in all three SDKs. TypeScript ships 1.2.0, Python 1.2.0 and Dart 2.2.0 alongside it, each restoring the `X-Client: sdk` request header that sets `created_via`. Full suite: 86 files, 1300 tests.

## 0.38.0 (2026-08-27)

Feature and defect release (PRs #39 through #42, #46 through #50, #55, and the post-merge review). The admin links listing now pages in SQL, and the release closes a batch of defects across the admin UI, the MCP server, the browser extension, and the SDKs.

- **The links listing serves one page at a time.** Filtering, sorting and the window all run in SQL through `LinkRepository.page()`, so rendering 25 rows costs three statements whatever the catalog size, and only the served rows get delta enrichment. Search, status filter, sort and range survive page changes, `per_page` caps at 100 (D1 binds one parameter per served row to fetch its slugs), and a page number past the end clamps to the last populated window instead of rendering empty. Migration `0007` adds `idx_links_created_at` on `links(created_at DESC, id DESC)` so the planner walks the index and stops after `limit + offset` rows rather than sorting the table per request.
- **Search, owner and URL lookups share one SQL definition and no fan-out.** `search()`, `findByOwner()` and `findByUrl()` fetched every match through `getById`, two statements per row, so a broad search over a large catalog exhausted D1's per-invocation subrequest budget. All three now derive their predicate from the same fragment as the paginated listing and cost two statements total.
- **Delta pills aggregate only the served links.** The per-link click delta grouped every click in the range to label one page of rows. The group-by now restricts to the ids on the page while they fit inside D1's parameter cap.
- **Paginator scales past a handful of pages.** Large page counts collapse to a window around the current page with ellipses. The paginator is a `nav` landmark with translated previous/next names and `aria-current` on the active page, hides when the result set fits one page while the per-page selector stays reachable, and on narrow screens scrolls and tabs in reading order.
- **Empty states say what emptied the list.** Four cases with their own copy: no links yet, every link expired, the status filter matched none, and a search matched none. The search case names the query (clipped by code point at 60 characters) and the chip narrowing alongside it. A search of only whitespace no longer blames whichever filter was selected. The removed "Show disabled" toggle no longer appears in copy.
- **Every links row has a keyboard path to its detail page.** The row label is a link, so a keyboard user reaches the detail page without a pointer.
- **One primary-slug pick on every surface.** The dashboard recent-links and top-links widgets ignored `is_primary` and named a link by its auto-generated slug. Every surface (links list, link detail, dashboard widgets, QR endpoint, MCP server, browser-side copy chip) now calls `pickPrimarySlug`: the flagged primary, then the first custom slug, then the first of any kind.
- **The links page counts and windows against one clock read.** `count()` and the row query each read `Date.now()`, so a link expiring between the two was counted and then excluded, printing a total one higher than the table.
- **Slug mutation endpoints match slugs case-insensitively.** Set-primary, disable, enable and remove lowercased nothing, so a mixed-case slug in the path returned 404 for a slug that resolves on redirect.
- **Bundle stats compute the top country's share against the full total.** The denominator was the sum of the top-10 list, which inflated the share past ten distinct countries.
- **Interpolated `{param}` values are literal text.** `t()` used a string replacement, so `$&`, `` $` `` and `$1` in a value expanded as replacement patterns.
- **The clicks column header localizes its range label.** The header printed the raw range token (`7d`) instead of the translated label.
- **API key scope badges translate.** The keys page rendered the raw scope tokens `create` and `read`.
- **MCP `create_link` declares its idempotent upsert contract.** The description states that a repeat call with the same destination returns the existing link, and the annotation moves from write-new to idempotent so agents stop searching before creating.
- OpenAPI paths and schemas are unchanged from 0.37.1; only `info.version` changes. The bump refreshes the recorded spec hash in all three SDKs. TypeScript ships 1.1.4 and Python 1.1.3 with their own fixes; Dart takes the hash refresh alone in 2.1.3. Full suite: 85 files, 1267 tests.

## 0.37.1 (2026-08-10)

Defect-fix release (PRs #36, #37, and the weekly review batch). No new endpoints or schema changes.

- **Stored XSS closed in the bundle icon picker.** The icon name was interpolated into an inline `onclick` JS-string argument. A bundle icon is a free-text field with no charset restriction, so a quote in the value broke out of the string literal into executable script. The name now rides on `data-icon` and the handler reads `this.dataset.icon`. `esc()` also escapes the double-quote character, which `textContent`/`innerHTML` round-tripping leaves untouched, so a quote in any value placed inside a double-quoted attribute can no longer close it early.
- **Bundle analytics no longer fails past 99 member slugs.** D1 caps a prepared statement at 100 bound parameters. Expanding a bundle's member slugs into an `IN (?,?,...)` list crossed that cap on wide bundles and failed the whole analytics page with `SQLITE_ERROR`. Every bundle-scoped click query now resolves membership inside SQLite from the bundle id, holding the bind count at one regardless of bundle size. The planner still drives the lookup off `idx_clicks_slug`.
- **Bundle member slugs load on one bound parameter.** `BundleRepository` bound one parameter per member link to read their slugs, hitting the same D1 cap from the other direction. The membership subquery replaces the id list.
- **Admin toasts survive a response carrying no JSON body.** Failure paths called `res.json()` and rendered `data.error`, so a 502 from an edge proxy or any non-JSON error body rejected the promise and left the button silent with nothing shown to the user. Every such path now falls back to its translated default message.
- **Deleting a custom slug reports the deletion.** The success toast read "Custom slug added". Its failure toast, and those for set-primary, disable, and enable, showed a bare untranslated "Error".
- **Custom slugs enforce a maximum length.** `validateCustomSlug` checked the lower bound and the charset but never the upper, so a caller could store a slug longer than `MAX_SLUG_LENGTH` through the API while the random generator stayed within it.
- **A trailing `?` inside a fragment survives normalization.** The trailing-`?` strip ran unconditionally, so `https://example.com/#section?` lost a character of fragment content. A `?` at the end only denotes an empty query string when no `#` has opened a fragment ahead of it.
- **`fetchPageTitle` drains non-HTML bodies.** The early return on a non-HTML content type abandoned the response stream. Most destination URLs are not HTML (APIs, PDFs, images), and this runs on every link creation, so the leak sat on the common path.
- **Remaining hardcoded admin strings route through `t()`.** The add-slug modal's field label and four slug-action error messages were inline English.
- OpenAPI paths and schemas are unchanged from 0.37.0; only `info.version` changes. The bump refreshes the recorded spec hash in all three SDKs. TypeScript ships 1.1.3, Python 1.1.2, and Dart 2.1.2 alongside it. Full suite: 76 files, 1128 tests.

## 0.37.0 (2026-08-05)

Feature and defect release (PRs #34, #35). Adds per-point dates to the clicks-over-time chart and closes three defects from the weekly review.

- **Chart points name their date on hover.** All three clicks-over-time charts (dashboard timeline widget, bundle detail, link detail) show the bucket a point covers. Each point carries a full-height invisible hover band, so the cursor does not have to land on the dot to read the tooltip. Buckets are UTC and format in UTC to line up with the axis offsets, localized to the viewer's language; the trailing point stays marked as partial. `src/db` exports `sparklineBucketLabels` to pair canonical bucket labels with a `getSparkline` series.
- **`addLinkToBundle` returns 404 under a concurrent-delete race.** `INSERT OR IGNORE` suppresses UNIQUE, NOT NULL, and CHECK violations, not foreign-key ones. A bundle or link deleted between the existence checks and the insert tripped the `bundle_links` FK constraint and surfaced as an unhandled 500. The violation now maps to 404, matching every other concurrent-delete race in the service layer.
- **Negative pagination params clamp to 1.** `parseInt(...) || fallback` catches `0` and `NaN` but not negative integers, so `?page=-3` on the admin links listing rendered an empty table under a negative-range summary, and a negative `per_page` inverted the slice bounds. Both clamp at the parsing site.
- **MCP `list_bundles` description matches its behavior.** The tool described bundles as owned by the caller while `listBundles()` reads openly across owners, so an agent could relay another user's bundle names, descriptions, and click stats believing the results were caller-scoped. Documentation correction, no behavior change.
- OpenAPI paths and schemas are unchanged from 0.36.2; only `info.version` changes. The bump refreshes the recorded spec hash in all three SDKs. The TypeScript SDK ships a separate fix in 1.1.2; Python and Dart take the hash refresh alone. Full suite: 72 files, 1067 tests.

## 0.36.2 (2026-07-28)

Defect-fix and maintenance release (PRs #29 through #33). No new endpoints or schema changes.

- **Link writes check ownership.** `PUT /links/{id}`, the MCP `update_link` tool, and the admin set-primary-slug route accepted any authenticated key, so a caller could rewrite the destination URL of a link owned by someone else. Both operations now return 403 unless the caller created the link, matching the gate already enforced on disable, enable, delete, and the slug routes. Reads stay open across owners by design.
- **Concurrent-delete races return 404 instead of 200.** Bundle update, archive, unarchive, delete, and analytics, plus set-primary-slug, re-read the row after writing and reported success with a null payload when a parallel request had deleted it. Each now propagates 404. `BundleRepository.delete` reads the D1 `changes` count instead of assuming its `DELETE` matched a row.
- **URL normalization preserves query and fragment content.** Stripping trailing `/`, `?`, and `#` ran as one greedy character-class replace, so `https://example.com/search?q=cats/` lost its trailing slash and a hash-router path like `/#/spa/route/` was truncated. An empty `?` or `#` still drops, and trailing path slashes drop only when no query or fragment follows.
- **A malformed stored URL redirects to 404, not 500.** A KV entry holding an unparseable URL threw inside `new URL()` and surfaced as a 500. The redirect handler returns the 404 page instead.
- **QR fixes.** Slug lookup matches case-insensitively, so `?slug=MyLink` resolves the stored lowercase slug rather than returning 404 (API route and MCP tool both). The QR response now carries `Cache-Control: private`, so a shared cache cannot store a bearer-authenticated response and serve the link-id to slug mapping to unauthenticated clients.
- **Admin UI hardening.** The duplicate-link and delete-key buttons carry their URL and title on `data-*` attributes read by a delegated listener, replacing inline `onclick` arguments that HTML-escaping could not make safe: `esc()` leaves `'` alone, so an apostrophe in a URL or key title broke out of the JS string.
- **Range picker translated.** The time-range buttons and their group `aria-label` render through `t()` instead of hardcoded English.
- **Dependency refresh (PR #33).** Upgrades the runtime stack (`hono`, `@hono/zod-openapi`, `agents`, `jose`, `@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider`) and the toolchain (`wrangler`, `@cloudflare/workers-types` to v5, `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`, `vitest`, `tsx`), pins `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` to an exact 1.29.0, and moves the GitHub Actions to their current majors.
- OpenAPI paths and schemas are unchanged from 0.36.1; only `info.version` changes. The emitted document stayed byte-identical across the `@hono/zod-openapi` upgrade, so the spec hash moves for the version string alone. The bump refreshes the recorded hash in all three SDKs. Full suite: 72 files, 1063 tests.

## 0.36.1 (2026-06-30)

Maintenance release (PRs #27, #28). No new endpoints or schema changes.

- **Dependency refresh.** Upgrades all app and tooling dependencies to their latest versions and pins the build to Node >=22.18.0.
- **Type-narrowed background handlers.** Handlers that only schedule deferred work now accept a `WaitUntilContext` (`Pick<ExecutionContext, "waitUntil">`) instead of the full `ExecutionContext`, so Hono's `c.executionCtx` passes directly and the prior unsafe casts drop out.
- **UI fixes.** Bundle overview cards clamp titles to two lines and reserve that height so cards stay aligned. The API keys page corrects scope-pill spacing.
- OpenAPI paths and schemas are unchanged from 0.36.0; only `info.version` changes. The bump refreshes the recorded spec hash in all three SDKs, with no SDK code changes. Full suite: 72 files, 1042 tests.

## 0.36.0 (2026-06-24)

Feature release. Rebuilds the admin dashboard on htmx widget islands, redesigns the API keys page, enriches bundle overview cards, and adds a paginated analytics breakdown endpoint. PRs #16, #18, #19, #21, #22, #24, #25, #26.

- **Widget-island dashboard.** The dashboard renders as a shell of placeholders and loads each panel (KPIs, timeline, top links, top countries, top domains, recent links) as an independent widget over htmx (vendored 2.0.4). A generic admin widget route serves each fragment with per-widget Cache API caching keyed by range, language, and filters, invalidated by a KV version token. Admin writes bump that token best-effort so panels refresh after an edit. The widget context builds from a single settings fetch per request.
- **API keys page redesigned for onboarding.** The keys page walks a developer from key creation to first call and lists the published SDKs through a shared `SdkList` component.
- **Bundle overview cards** show average clicks per day and traffic coverage, aligned with the bundle detail page.
- **Paginated breakdown.** `links` and `bundles` expose a `breakdown` endpoint for the countries, sources, and domains panels (offset/limit, returns items plus total) with a deterministic tie-break in the ordering, and the admin detail pages paginate those panels. The client method shipped earlier in the SDKs (npm/py 1.1.0, Dart 2.1.0).
- **Fixes.** The dashboard counts distinct referrer hosts exactly and shows the primary slug in the most-clicked panel. Dashboard link deltas enrich in bulk to cut per-request CPU. The widget error fragment escapes interpolated values, cache-key parts are url-encoded, and disabled links stay resolvable for up to one second after disabling. Slug copy moved to a delegated `data-*` handler that skips empty targets.
- OpenAPI paths and schemas are unchanged from 0.35.5 (the breakdown endpoint was already in the recorded spec); only `info.version` changes. The bump refreshes the recorded spec hash in all three SDKs, with no SDK code changes. Full suite: 72 files, 1042 tests.

## 0.35.5 (2026-06-17)

Defect-review release (PR #15) fixing analytics "Sources" inflation. No new features.

- Shortlinks no longer appear as referring sources for their own clicks. Self-referrer detection broadened from the bare-origin root to any same-host slug: a slug is never a page, it only 301s away, so a `Referer` pointing at one can only be a self-referral artifact (a self-looping or cross-slug crawler that stamps `Referer` with the URL it fetched). Such clicks now carry the `is_self_referrer` flag and drop out of the Sources breakdown and totals under the default filters.
- The rule matches the actual slug route shape (a single path segment outside the reserved `_` namespace), so real same-host endpoints like `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` and `/cdn-cgi/access/*` stay as meaningful referrers. The own host is read per request, so no domain is hardcoded and every deployment works.
- OpenAPI surface unchanged. The version bump refreshes the recorded spec hash in all three SDKs; no SDK code changes. Full suite: 50 files, 953 tests.

## 0.35.4 (2026-06-15)

Defect-review release (PR #14) extending the 0.35.3 concurrency hardening to slug removal and disable. No new features.

- Removing a slug no longer orphans analytics rows when a click lands mid-operation. The lifetime guard moved inside the delete transaction as a `NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM clicks ...)` condition, so a click recorded between the service's pre-read and the batch delete blocks the delete instead of stranding its click rows.
- Removing or disabling a primary slug no longer leaves a link with two primaries under concurrency. The primary handover re-checks inside the batch that the slug still holds primary, so a concurrent `setPrimary` that moved primary to another slug can no longer promote the random slug alongside the new primary.
- `removeSlug` reports the real outcome instead of a false success. When the guard blocks the delete, the API returns 400 (slug still present, has clicks) or 404 (slug left this link concurrently) rather than `{ removed: true }`, and the cache entry is evicted only after a confirmed delete so a still-resolving slug is not dropped. The 404-vs-400 disambiguation compares `link_id`, since a freed slug value can be re-claimed by another link.
- OpenAPI surface unchanged. The version bump refreshes the recorded spec hash in all three SDKs; no SDK code changes. Full suite: 50 files, 938 tests.

## 0.35.3 (2026-06-12)

Robustness release: two defect-review PRs (#12, #13) hardening concurrency, input validation, and redirect behavior. No new features.

- Slug redirects now send `Cache-Control: private, max-age=90` alongside the 301. A bare 301 is cached by browsers indefinitely, so returning visitors skipped the Worker forever: disabling, expiring, or retargeting a link never reached them and their repeat clicks went unrecorded. The short private max-age (the Bitly approach) keeps the SEO semantics while forcing revalidation within seconds.
- `expires_at = 0` now reads as a real epoch timestamp (expired) instead of "no expiry". The redirect handler and the admin pages (expired filter, expired badge, expiry control) use null-aware checks, matching the documented contract that null means no expiry.
- Multi-statement mutations run in transactional D1 batches: link deletion, custom slug insertion with primary handover, slug disable/remove primary fallback. A mid-sequence failure can no longer orphan slug or click rows or strand a link without a primary slug. `setPrimary` collapsed to a single conditional UPDATE that no-ops when the slug does not belong to the link; previously a mismatched slug cleared every primary flag and set none.
- The "never delete a link with clicks" guard moved inside the delete transaction as a `NOT EXISTS` condition. A click recorded between the service's check and the delete now blocks the delete instead of being silently removed with the link.
- Concurrent requests racing on the same custom slug get a 409 from the UNIQUE constraint instead of an unhandled 500. `disableSlug`/`enableSlug` return 404 instead of crashing when the slug is concurrently deleted.
- Link search escapes SQLite LIKE metacharacters. Searching for `_` previously matched every link; `%` and `\` are escaped the same way and every comparison carries `ESCAPE '\'`.
- MCP `get_link_qr` encodes `utm_medium=qr` instead of a bare `?qr`, so scans of MCP-issued QR codes register as QR traffic in analytics, matching the REST QR endpoint.
- Settings validation: theme and lang are checked against their allowed sets on write and clamped to null on read (legacy rows and direct D1 edits no longer leak unknown values), API key titles cap at 120 characters, and a corrupted stored `slug_default_length` falls back to the default instead of returning NaN or blocking link creation.
- The admin JSON path (no zod schema) now rejects malformed field types at the service layer: non-string labels and non-integer or negative `expires_at` values return 400 instead of being stored verbatim.
- `getBundle` applies the viewer's bot and self-referrer filter preferences, so bundle detail and the MCP `get_bundle` tool report the same totals as the bundles list.
- With Cloudflare Access configured, unauthenticated requests to `/_/admin/api/*` get 401 JSON instead of a 302 redirect to the landing page; page routes keep the redirect. Theme and lang cookie values clamp to known sets before rendering.
- OpenAPI surface unchanged. The version bump refreshes the recorded spec hash in all three SDKs; no SDK code changes. Full suite: 50 files, 932 tests.

## 0.35.2 (2026-05-30)

- Link deletion no longer reports success when the database guard blocks it. `deleteLink` now honors the boolean from `LinkRepository.delete()`: if a click lands between the service's click check and the row delete, the API returns the real outcome instead of `{ deleted: true }`. A link that gained clicks returns 400, a link that was concurrently removed returns 404. The existence check on that path uses a cheap `SELECT 1` rather than a full link load.
- Deleting a link evicts the slug set captured at delete time, not the slugs read at the start of the call. A custom slug added in the race window is now removed from KV instead of lingering with no TTL, which had kept the deleted link resolving on redirects.
- `disableLink` returns 404 when the link is concurrently deleted instead of throwing a 500. It now null-guards the repository result the same way `enableLink` already did.
- Dependency refresh: `wrangler 4.88 → 4.95`, `hono 4.12.18 → 4.12.23`, `agents 0.12.3 → 0.13.3`, `@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider 0.5 → 0.7`, `@hono/zod-openapi 1.3 → 1.4`, `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers 0.16.0 → 0.16.10`, `@cloudflare/workers-types → 4.20260528`.
- CI reads the Node version from `package.json` (pinned to 22) instead of hardcoding 24, so the tested major matches the supported floor.
- OpenAPI surface unchanged. The version bump refreshes the recorded spec hash in all three SDKs; no SDK code changes.

## 0.35.1 (2026-05-07)

- Admin views that render "the link" (link-stat copy, link-create success state) now select the user's primary slug instead of the first auto-generated one. A `pickPrimarySlug` helper centralizes the rule (`is_primary` first, otherwise the lowest-id slug) so every surface picks the same slug for the same record.
- `TIMELINE_RANGES` is now the single source of truth for timeline-range tuples. `RangeSchema`, `RANGE_VALUES`, the admin time-range selector, analytics defaults, and bundle defaults all derive from this constant; the previous `?? "30d"` fallbacks scattered across files now reference an exported `DEFAULT_TIMELINE_RANGE`. OpenAPI surface unchanged.
- Runtime and dev dependencies refreshed to current published versions: `@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider 0.4 → 0.5`, `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers 0.15 → 0.16`, `@cloudflare/workers-types 4.20260426 → 4.20260507`, `agents 0.11.6 → 0.12.3`, `hono 4.12.15 → 4.12.18`, `wrangler 4.86 → 4.88`, `zod 4.3 → 4.4`. The full vitest suite (50 files, 889 tests) passes against the new versions.

## 0.35.0 (2026-05-01)

- Android (and iOS) in-app browser clicks now attribute to the originating brand in the Domains breakdown. The new `src/referrer.ts` module maps known package identifiers (`com.linkedin.android` → `linkedin.com`, `com.twitter.android` → `x.com`, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Reddit, Pinterest, Slack, Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, YouTube, Gmail, Outlook) to their canonical domain, so a click from the LinkedIn Android app shows up under `linkedin.com` instead of as an opaque `android-app://com.linkedin.android/`. Uncurated packages fall through to "no referrer" rather than polluting the breakdown.
- Sources panel (raw-URL referrer breakdown) now hides `android-app://` and `ios-app://` Referer values. The brand attribution lives in the Domains panel via `referrer_host`; the raw row stays in the database for forensics and future re-attribution. Distinct-referrer counts are scoped consistently in both the link-detail and bundle analytics paths.

## 0.34.0 (2026-04-30)

- Bundle access model now matches links and slugs: anyone with a valid API key can read a bundle and append links to it, and only the bundle owner can remove links, archive, unarchive, update, or delete. Non-owner write attempts return `403 Forbidden` instead of the previous `404 Not Found`, so callers can tell "I don't have permission" apart from "this bundle does not exist". Read endpoints stay open across owners by design.
- API contract tightened in three places. `url` on link create/update is capped at 2048 characters (aligned with IE 2083 and bit.ly 2000, long enough for typical UTM-laden URLs). `slug` on `POST /_/api/slugs` now matches the server-side validator exactly: `[a-z0-9]` at the start and end, hyphens allowed only in the middle, no underscores. Previously the regex was a permissive prefilter that accepted strings the service layer would then reject with a different error phrasing. `expires_at` on link create/update rejects negative Unix timestamps, which previously created links that read as already expired.
- MCP server: removed `add_vanity_slug` (and the `vanity_slug` parameter on link creation) in favor of the standalone slug tools. Added `disable_slug`, `enable_slug`, and `remove_slug` so an LLM can manage slug lifecycle the same way the admin UI does. `search_links` and `list_links_by_owner` honor `range`, filter, and delta scoping consistent with the rest of the analytics surface; `range` is plumbed through every list and get tool to match the API. Tool schemas import the shared API schemas so the contract stays in lockstep with the server.
- Slug rejection messaging clarified: requests that ask the server to "create a random slug" now state that explicitly instead of relaying the lower-level validation message.

## 0.33.0 (2026-04-29)

- The public bearer-token API (`/_/api/*`) now serves an OpenAPI 3.1 spec at `/_/api/openapi.json` and an embedded Scalar API reference at `/_/api/docs`. Every public endpoint declares typed request and response schemas via `@hono/zod-openapi`, so the spec stays in lockstep with the server. The auth-by-prefix table in the README is replaced by a pointer to the live docs. Strict validation rejects request bodies with unknown fields (`400 {"error": "Unknown field \"<name>\""}`); path-param `:id` parsing keeps returning `404` on non-numeric values. The link and bundle list/get endpoints (`GET /api/links`, `GET /api/links/:id`, `GET /api/bundles`, `GET /api/bundles/:id`) now accept an optional `?range=` query parameter (`24h`, `7d`, `30d`, `90d`, `1y`, `all`); when given, it scopes `total_clicks` and adds `delta_pct` versus the prior window of equal length, mirroring the admin UI. Existing tests pass unchanged.
- `GET /_/api/bundles/:id` now always returns the `BundleWithSummary` shape (with `link_count`, `total_clicks`, `delta_pct?`, `sparkline?`, `top_links?`); previously it returned the bare `Bundle`. Additive change at the JSON level: existing fields are preserved.
- MCP server tools migrate to the spec's `registerTool` API. Every tool now declares standard annotations (`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, `openWorldHint`) so MCP clients see intent declared rather than inferred from prose.
- Analytics MCP responses front-load `range_used`, a human-readable `range_label`, and a `range_note` ("scoped to the last N days, clicks outside this window are NOT included" / "covers all clicks ever recorded") at the top of the JSON the LLM reads. Tool descriptions now repeat the scoping rule so follow-up calls stay on the same window instead of mixing 7d and 30d numbers in one analysis.
- Removed the "use last selection" choice from the default time-range setting. It never persisted a real last selection: each page fell back to its own window (30d on dashboard, links, and bundle detail; all-time on link detail and bundles), so the option behaved inconsistently. `getAppSettings` now returns a real `TimelineRange` for every user, defaulting to 30d, and every route reads it directly.
- Bundle detail's first paint now honors the viewer's "filter bots" and "filter self-referrers" toggles. Previously the SSR handler skipped filter resolution, so totals, breakdowns, timeline, and per-link rows showed unfiltered numbers until the client hydrated.

## 0.32.0 (2026-04-28)

- Analytics filters and time range now apply consistently across every UI surface. Previously the dashboard's "Recent Links" card showed unfiltered lifetime totals while the rest of the dashboard honored the user's bot-filter and self-referrer settings, so the same link could read 9 there and 3 on its detail page. Click counts everywhere (recent links, links list, link detail slug rows, bundle list cards, bundle detail) now resolve through a single shared filter+range subquery.
- The links list page (`/_/admin/links`) and bundles list page (`/_/admin/bundles`) gain a time-range selector matching the dashboard. The selected range scopes the displayed click totals, sparklines, and trend deltas, and is preserved across filter and sort navigation. Both pages fall back to the user's `default_range` setting when no `?range=` is given.
- Link detail server render now matches the client-side hydration. Before, the page first painted with all-time unfiltered numbers and then flickered to the filtered/range-bounded numbers a tick later. The route now resolves the user's filters and `default_range` once and passes them into both the analytics call and the slug breakdown so the first paint is correct.
- Public API time-range contract: `GET /_/api/links/:id/analytics` and `GET /_/api/bundles/:id/analytics` now default to all-time when no `?range=` is provided and accept the optional override. The previous bundle endpoint defaulted to 30d. The public API also returns raw click counts and ignores the API key owner's filter preferences, so SDK consumers get unfiltered data unless they post-process. Admin-side analytics are unchanged.
- MCP analytics tools mirror the admin UI defaults. When a tool is called without a range, it falls back to the user's `default_range` setting (then 30d). Every analytics tool response now carries a `range_used` field so the requesting AI can tell which window the numbers cover.

## 0.31.6 (2026-04-24)

- Settings page reorder: "Default Slug Length" now sits directly under "Theme", grouping it with the other setup-phase control. "Default Time Range" and "Analytics Filters" follow below as viewing preferences.

## 0.31.5 (2026-04-24)

- Two new per-user settings toggles, both on by default: "Filter out bot traffic" and "Filter out self-referrers". When enabled, matching clicks drop out of every analytics surface: dashboard KPIs and sparklines, link-detail stats, bundle analytics, top countries, referrers, access-method counters, and the MCP analytics tools. Turn one off to see raw numbers.
- Bot classification was already recorded at ingest but previously filtered nowhere. The self-referrer flag previously only hid referrers from the breakdown panel. With the new toggles these flags now drive the full analytics stack and totals honor the setting too.
- Ingest path continues to stamp `is_bot` via the User-Agent heuristic and `is_self_referrer` via bare-origin same-host detection; nothing about ingestion changed.

## 0.31.4 (2026-04-23)

- Settings → Integrations sidebar now shows a single "SDKs" card listing TypeScript, Python, and Dart side by side, each linking to its registry page. Python joins the list; the earlier layout of one full card per language did not scale past two and repeated the same description each time. MCP Server stays its own card.
- Split the shared `release-sdk.yml` reusable workflow into three per-registry workflows (`release-sdk-npm.yml`, `release-sdk-pub.yml`, `release-sdk-python.yml`) so each track owns its own trigger, lint, test, build, and publish steps. Publishing behavior is unchanged; the per-registry files are easier to reason about when one track needs a tweak.

## 0.31.3 (2026-04-23)

- Slug disable, enable, and remove operations now available on the public `/_/api/*` bearer-token API. Ownership is enforced the same way as existing link mutations: the API key owner can act on slugs of links they own, and is blocked with 403 on anyone else's. The SDKs (TypeScript, Dart, Python) already pointed at these routes, so they start working the moment this change ships.

## 0.31.2 (2026-04-22)

- Fixed the "avg/day" stat on link detail and bundle detail computing against lifetime data instead of the selected range window, which made the average look artificially low on short ranges.
- Thousands separators on admin pages now follow the UI language (e.g. `1,234` in English, `1 234` in Swedish, `1.234` in Indonesian) instead of the browser locale.
- Trimmed the bundles list card: the trend delta moves into the card header, the separate "vs. prev" column and the top-links preview are gone, and the intro explainer card is dropped since the detail page already covers it.

## 0.31.1 (2026-04-22)

- Bundle detail "Add a link to this bundle" picker now hides links that are already in the bundle, so the choices shown are only the ones you can actually add. When every link is already attached, the picker shows an empty-state hint instead of a blank list.

## 0.31.0 (2026-04-22)

- Introduced Bundles: a new admin section that groups related links so you can read combined engagement across a project or campaign. The listing shows lifetime clicks, a 30-day sparkline, and a trend reading; the detail page mirrors link-detail's analytics grid but aggregates across every link in the bundle. A link can belong to zero or many bundles, and link-detail shows bundle membership as accent chips. Accents (orange/red/green/blue/purple) and Material Symbol icons let you visually distinguish bundles.
- Exposed the bundle surface on the admin API, the public API, and MCP. Public endpoints cover create, list, read, update, delete, archive, unarchive, add/remove links, per-link bundles, and per-bundle analytics. Both SDKs (`@oddbit/shrtnr` 0.7.0 and the Dart `shrtnr` 0.2.0) carry matching methods.
- Started recording a silent per-visitor fingerprint on the redirect path: SHA-256 of IP + User-Agent + a daily-rotated HMAC salt. No raw IP is persisted, the daily rotation means fingerprints cannot be correlated across days, and nothing surfaces in the UI yet. Set `FP_SALT` in production for unpredictability; a deterministic per-day fallback keeps local dev working.
- Unified referrer terminology on the dashboard and link detail: one "Referrers" breakdown backed by `referrer_host`, replacing the earlier "Sources"/"Referrer Hosts" split. The dashboard swaps the "Top Domains" panel for "Top Referrers".
- Hardened the bundle-detail archive/delete buttons against bundle names containing a single quote. The buttons now read the name from `data-*` attributes via a delegated click handler instead of interpolating it into an inline onclick literal.
- Fixed `countries_reached` on bundle analytics under-reporting once a bundle saw traffic from more than ten distinct countries. Replaced a correlated subquery in the bundles list summary with a straight slug join. Bundle "top links" now falls back to any slug when no primary exists and never emits an empty chip.
- Bundle detail polish: link rows mirror the dashboard "Most clicked" stack (slug chip on top of a full-width progress bar, full URL underneath), count and percentage columns use tabular-nums so numbers line up across rows, and the card placeholder renders at a readable size instead of wrapping "no baseline" onto two oversized lines.
- Extracted the duplicated `escHtml` helper into `src/escape.ts` and dropped the dead `userEmail` plumbing through the admin layout.

## 0.30.1 (2026-04-21)

- Fixed stack overflow on every MCP write call (`create_link`, `disable_link`, `enable_link`, `delete_link`). The `identity` getter was returning `this.identity` and recursing indefinitely; it now returns the authenticated email from the Cloudflare Access props.
- Clarified the `create_link` MCP tool contract: the description now states that an existing destination URL returns the existing link with `duplicate: true` instead of failing, so callers no longer need to pre-check availability with `search_links`. The service-level duplicate flag is now propagated into the MCP response payload.

## 0.30.0 (2026-04-21)

- Reshaped the dashboard KPI strip. The top row is now four cards (Total Links, Clicked Links, Total Clicks, Clicks/Day), each carrying a sparkline and a period-delta pill.
- New "Clicked Links" KPI counts distinct links that received at least one click in the selected window, with its own sparkline and trend against the previous equivalent period.
- Moved domain and country totals out of the KPI strip, since those cardinality metrics saturate over time. They now sit as small pills in the "Top Countries" and "Top Domains" panel headers, without misleading trend indicators.

## 0.29.2 (2026-04-21)

- Fixed the trend delta pill showing a misleading "+100%" (or similar) figure for links and dashboards whose selected range had no prior-period history to compare against. When there is no baseline, the delta pill is now suppressed rather than rendering a deceptive growth number against zero.

## 0.29.1 (2026-04-20)

- Fixed the Total Links KPI card displaying the lifetime count regardless of the selected range. It now counts links created within the chosen window, matching the Total Clicks behavior.
- Fixed dashboard live polling ignoring the selected time range. Auto-refresh now preserves the active range instead of snapping breakdowns back to the default.

## 0.29.0 (2026-04-20)

- New per-user "default time range" setting on the settings page. When set, the dashboard and link detail pages open in the chosen range; the dashboard `?range=` query param still overrides it. Unset preserves the previous behavior.
- Dashboard top countries, top sources, and most-clicked links now respect the selected time range. "Most clicked" ranks by clicks within the window and can show fewer than five entries (down to zero) when no clicks fell in range. Recent links stays lifetime-newest since "recent" is not a range-relative concept.
- Dashboard gained a large clicks-over-time card with a gradient area chart, and the Total Clicks sparkline now fills with a soft gradient instead of a stroke-only polyline.
- Links list page redesigned to match the new design: clicks column header includes the range window ("Clicks (30d)"), the delta pill sits next to the created date so dates align across rows, the short-URL cell is a pill chip with a colored dot, and pagination shows a "1–N of Total" summary with a dropdown page-size picker.
- Native `<select>` chevron replaced with a filled triangle across all admin dropdowns for consistent styling.

## 0.28.2 (2026-04-17)

- Mobile layout fixes on the admin dashboard and link detail pages. The sticky top bar now correctly pins to the viewport, cards span full width when no neighbor fits beside them, the date range selector wraps below the "Link Details" title instead of clipping off-screen, and long source URLs and slug click counts no longer overflow their cards. Progress bars are hidden on mobile so the counts stay on-screen.

## 0.28.1 (2026-04-17)

- Fixed stale styles after deploys. Admin, landing, 404, and MCP landing HTML responses now send `Cache-Control: private, no-cache, must-revalidate`, forcing browsers to revalidate the document (and its inline CSS/JS) on every request. JSON API responses are unaffected.

## 0.28.0 (2026-04-17)

- KV write-through cache for slug redirects. Slug lookups now check Workers KV before hitting D1, reducing redirect latency for hot links.
- Fixed duplicate detection treating URLs with trailing `/`, `?`, or `#` as distinct from the clean URL. These trailing characters are now stripped before lookup and storage.

## 0.27.2 (2026-04-16)

- Fixed landing page not redirecting logged-in users to the dashboard. The `CF_Authorization` cookie is now used as a fallback when the `Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion` header is absent (unprotected routes).
- Links listing page now shows only the primary slug instead of all slugs.
- Source URLs on the link detail page now display below the progress bar instead of inline, preventing truncation.

## 0.27.1 (2026-04-10)

- Fixed escaping of slug strings in admin action modals on the link detail page.
- Fixed analytics per-slug click chart to use the correct slug property from the stats response.

## 0.27.0 (2026-04-10)

### Slug text as primary key

The numeric `id` column on the `slugs` table is removed. The slug string itself is now the primary key, since it is already unique and is the natural identifier used in all URLs and API calls.

- `clicks.slug_id` (integer FK) replaced by `clicks.slug` (text FK). Migration 0004 preserves all existing click data by resolving each row's slug text before the schema change, then restoring from a backup table.
- All slug-management API endpoints (disable, enable, remove, set-primary) now use the slug text in the URL path instead of a numeric id. Example: `POST /_/api/links/5/slugs/my-campaign/disable`.
- SDK updated to 0.6.0: `disableSlug`, `enableSlug`, and `removeSlug` now accept a slug string instead of a numeric id.

## 0.26.1 (2026-04-10)

- MCP `create_link` now passes the authenticated user's email as `created_by`, so links created through MCP are owned by the caller.

## 0.26.0 (2026-04-10)

### Ownership-based access control

Links now have an owner: the identity that created them (`created_by`). Only the owner can disable, enable, or delete a link and its slugs. Other users keep read access and can still add custom slugs to any link.

- Admin routes enforce ownership using the Cloudflare Access identity. API routes use the API key owner's identity, so a key acts on behalf of its creator rather than as an anonymous actor. Links created via API now record `created_by` correctly.
- New `POST /enable` endpoint (admin and public API) to re-enable a disabled link. Replaces the previous pattern of clearing `expires_at` via PUT.
- New `enable_link` MCP tool with the same ownership check.
- The "Created by" field in link detail now shows the owner's email alongside an `app` / `api` / `mcp` / `sdk` badge.
- Sources stat bar subtitles now wrap instead of truncating with ellipsis, so full referrer URLs are visible.

## 0.25.0

- MCP endpoint moved from path-based (`/_/mcp`) to dedicated subdomain (`mcp.*`). CF Access MCP-type applications cannot be scoped to a path, so the Worker now detects requests on any `mcp.*` host and rewrites them to the internal `/_/mcp` handler. Paths reserved by Cloudflare (`/.well-known/*`, `/cdn-cgi/*`) are excluded from the rewrite.
- Updated README: MCP setup instructions now cover the subdomain requirement, Custom Domain registration, "Block AI bots" warning, and `claude.com` redirect URI. All client connection URLs updated from path-based to subdomain-based.
- Nine new MCP analytics tools: `get_trending_links`, `get_dashboard_stats`, `get_link_timeline`, `get_clicks_by_country`, `get_clicks_by_referrer`, `get_clicks_by_device`, `compare_links`, `get_link_breakdown`, and `get_total_clicks`. Each tool accepts a time range filter and configurable result limit.
- New `delete_link` MCP tool. Only links with zero clicks can be deleted; links with clicks should be disabled instead.
- Analytics service layer (`src/services/analytics.ts`) wraps the new repository queries with link existence checks and consistent error handling.

## 0.24.0 (2026-04-08)

### MCP auth switched to Cloudflare Access Managed OAuth

The custom OAuth provider (`@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider`) is replaced by Cloudflare's built-in Access Managed OAuth. MCP clients now authenticate through a standard CF Access login flow instead of a Worker-managed OAuth handshake.

- Removed `src/mcp/access-handler.ts`, `src/mcp/approval-dialog.ts`, `src/mcp/oauth-types.ts`, and `src/mcp/workers-oauth-utils.ts`. The Worker no longer implements its own OAuth 2.1 server.
- Removed the `OAUTH_KV` binding and the six `ACCESS_*` OAuth secrets. MCP auth relies on the same `ACCESS_AUD` JWT verification used by the admin UI.
- The Durable Object (`McpAgent`) is removed. MCP sessions are stateless again.
- Extracted `isSignedIn()` helper in `access.ts` to share JWT-check logic between admin routes and the landing page redirect.
- Refined light theme color palette for better contrast.
- Updated dependencies and added `engines.node >= 22` constraint to `package.json`.

## 0.23.2 (2026-04-07)

**Bar chart percentages**: Bar widths now reflect each item's share of the total clicks rather than its share of the top item's count. Indonesia at 5 of 9 total renders at 55%, not 100%.

**Sources full URL**: The Sources card now shows the hostname in the bar row and the full referrer URL below it, matching the layout of the Most Clicked card.

## 0.23.1 (2026-04-07)

Fixing bar charts length.

## 0.23.0 (2026-04-07)

### Auto-label, analytics range filter, and link detail redesign

**Auto-label from page title**: When a link is created without a label, the Worker fetches the destination page's `<title>` in the background (via `waitUntil`) and saves it as the label. The link detail page polls briefly after creation and updates the label display without a reload.

**Analytics range filter**: The analytics endpoint accepts a `?range=` parameter (24h, 7d, 30d, 90d, 1y, all) and filters every breakdown query by that window. The link detail page re-renders all stat cards on each range change.

**Per-slug click counts**: `ClickStats` now includes `slug_clicks`, so the link detail page shows a click bar for each slug driven by a single analytics response.

**Link detail page redesign**: The range selector moves to the page header. Stat cards (countries, referrers, devices, OS, browsers, link modes) update on range change instead of being server-rendered. The inline label editor is promoted to the top of the hero section. The links list now shows the label above the slugs.

**Referrer host normalization**: The `www.` prefix is stripped from referrer hosts on click recording, so `www.linkedin.com` and `linkedin.com` attribute to the same host.

**Schema cleanup**: Removed the `link_click_count` and `qr_click_count` counter columns from the `slugs` table. Click counts derive from aggregate queries against the `clicks` table.

## 0.22.0 (2026-04-07)

### Click count refactor, dashboard top domains, and icon fixes

**Click counts from aggregate queries**: `click_count` on slugs is now computed via a subquery against the `clicks` table rather than maintained as separate `link_click_count` and `qr_click_count` counter columns. This keeps counts consistent with the analytics data and removes the need to update counter columns on every click.

**Dashboard top domains**: The "Top Sources" panel is renamed "Top Domains" and now groups by `referrer_host` instead of the full referrer URL, giving cleaner domain-level attribution.

**iOS and macOS icons**: The OS breakdown icons for iOS and macOS now use valid Material Symbols glyphs (`phone_iphone` and `laptop_mac`) instead of the broken `apple` ligature.

## 0.21.0 (2026-04-06)

### Expanded analytics and interactive timeline chart

**Richer click tracking**: Each click now captures OS (parsed from User-Agent), referrer host, and link mode (link vs QR). The database schema and `ClickData` type reflect these additions.

**New analytics panels**: The link detail page gains dedicated breakdown panels for referrer hosts, operating systems, and access method (link vs QR), alongside the existing country, device, browser, and channel breakdowns.

**Interactive timeline chart**: The static clicks-over-time bar chart is replaced with a range-selectable timeline. Choose 24h (hourly), 7d, 30d, 90d (daily), 1y (weekly), or all-time (monthly). A summary row shows totals for each preset period at a glance. The chart fills zero-count buckets so the series is always continuous.

## 0.20.0 (2026-04-06)

### Admin UI improvements

**Landing page redirect**: Authenticated users visiting `/` are now redirected to `/_/admin/dashboard` instead of seeing the public landing page.

**Smart search/shorten input**: The URL input on the links list and dashboard pages is now dual-purpose. Pasting a URL shortens it as before. Typing plain text searches existing links by slug or description. The button shows "Shorten" with a lightning bolt by default and switches to "Search" with a magnifying glass when non-URL text is detected. The placeholder text reads "Paste URL or search links..." to communicate both actions.

**Delete zero-click links**: Links with no recorded clicks now show a "Delete" button instead of "Disable". Deleting removes the record from the database. Links that have been clicked can still only be disabled.

**Removed broken "Create new" button**: The "Create new" button that appeared in search results was removed. It attempted to create a link from the search query string, which always failed URL validation.

## 0.19.0 (2026-04-05)

### Separated link creation from custom slugs

Link creation and custom slug assignment are now separate operations at every layer.

**HTTP API**: `POST /_/api/links` no longer accepts `custom_slug`. Links are created with a random slug only. Custom slugs are added one-by-one via `POST /_/api/links/:id/slugs`, which returns 409 on collision.

**Service layer**: `createLink` generates a random slug. `addCustomSlugToLink` handles custom slugs individually with validation and collision checking.

**SDK** (`@oddbit/shrtnr` 0.4.0): `createLink` no longer accepts `custom_slug`. Use `addCustomSlug` after creation. The return type is `Link` (removed `CreateLinkResult` and `SlugRejection`).

**MCP**: `create_link` tool accepts `custom_slug` as before. Internally chains the same way as the SDK.

**Browser client**: The admin UI create-link form chains a create call followed by an add-slug call when a custom slug is provided.

## 0.18.1 (2026-04-06)

### Settings page

- Integration card link labels are now translatable. SDK card shows "npm package: @oddbit/shrtnr", MCP card shows "MCP documentation" (or "Setup guide in README" when not configured). Translations added for Indonesian and Swedish.

### Translations

- "More actions" button aria-label on the link detail page was hardcoded; now translated.
- "auto" badge text on auto-generated slugs was hardcoded; now translated.

## 0.18.0 (2026-04-05)

### Slug charset: lowercase only

- Random slug charset narrowed from 56 characters (mixed case + digits) to 32 characters: `abcdefghijkmnpqrstuvwxyz23456789`. Removes all uppercase letters and retains the existing exclusions of `l`, `o`, `0`, `1` to avoid visual ambiguity.
- Combination counts updated throughout settings UI and client JS — now derived from `RANDOM_CHARSET.length` rather than a hardcoded number.

### Case-insensitive routing

- Incoming short links are lowercased before lookup. A link stored as `abc` is reached by `ABC`, `Abc`, or `abc`.
- Custom slugs are lowercased at write time (create and add), so what is stored is always lowercase.

### Renamed: vanity slug → custom slug

- All internal references to "vanity slug" renamed to "custom slug" across source, tests, SDK, README, and CHANGELOG.
- MCP retains backward compatibility: the `add_vanity_slug` tool alias and the `vanity_slug` parameter on `create_link` remain accepted.

### Settings page

- Version and account sections redesigned. Account now shows email and logout inline in one row. Version status and install button sit in the same row.
- MCP integration card converted to a clickable link, matching the TypeScript SDK card pattern. "Configured" badge removed; a clean doc link replaces it.

### Minimum slug length constant

- Introduced `MIN_SLUG_LENGTH` in `constants.ts`. All validation, UI, and JS now reference this constant instead of hardcoding `3`.

## 0.17.0 (2026-04-05)

### Schema and data model

- Renamed `is_custom` column to `is_custom` in the `slugs` table. All queries, types, and service calls updated to match.
- Removed the stored `click_count` column from `slugs`. Click count is now computed at query time as `link_click_count + qr_click_count`.
- Consolidated all migrations into a single `0001_initial.sql` baseline.

### QR code click tracking

- Appended `?utm_medium=qr` to URLs encoded into QR codes. The redirect handler detects this parameter and increments `qr_click_count` instead of `link_click_count`.
- Both counts combine into a single `click_count` alias returned by all queries, so existing display logic requires no changes.
- The QR dialog does not expose the UTM-tagged URL to users.

### MCP backward compatibility

- `add_custom_slug` tool kept as an alias for `add_custom_slug`.
- `create_link` accepts both `custom_slug` and `custom_slug` input fields.

### Slug display order

- In the links list, the original random slug always appears first, followed by the primary custom slug, then remaining slugs ordered by creation date.

### Settings page

- Account section moved from the sidebar footer into a dedicated card on the settings page. Displays the signed-in email and a logout button.
- Sidebar no longer shows the account/logout block.



### UI/UX Improvements

- **Redesigned Link Details header:** New layout featuring a prominent total clicks counter and a cleaner metadata grid for label, creator, and expiry information.
- **Unified Slugs management:** Merged slug management and performance statistics into a single, cohesive table view with aligned progress bars and click counts.
- **Reorganized Analytics:** Restructured the analytics layout into two columns for better space utilization, placing time-series and source data in a wider left column and other stats in a narrower right column.
- **Responsive Enhancements:** Improved layout behavior for smaller screens and mobile devices.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where numeric 0 values were rendered as literal text in JSX.
- Fixed escaping of single quotes in the link duplication modal.

## 0.15.0

### Repository and service layer refactor

- `LinkRepository` and `SlugRepository` replace the previous flat database functions. All database access goes through these classes.
- Service functions are updated to call repository methods directly, removing the intermediate managed-service naming layer.
- `getLinkBySlug` is exposed as a standalone repository query.
- `wrangler.jsonc` replaces `wrangler.toml` as the config file format.

### Link search

- `LinkRepository.search()` queries links by label or slug substring, case-insensitive.
- `searchLinks()` service function wraps the repository call.
- `search_links` MCP tool lets AI clients find links by name, topic, or slug keyword.

## 0.14.0

### Per-user identity

Settings, API keys, and link authorship are now scoped per user identity extracted from the Cloudflare Access JWT.

- `extractIdentity()` reads claims in order: `email` → `phone` → `sub`, falling back to `"anonymous"`. Always returns a non-empty string safe for use as a database key.
- Theme, language, and slug default length are stored per user in the database. They load from the database on every admin page and fall back to the cookie, then to defaults. The cookie stays as a fast-render cache and is kept in sync.
- `setTheme()` and `setLanguage()` on the client persist the choice to the settings API, so preferences survive across browsers and devices.
- API keys are fully scoped: each user sees and can only delete their own keys.
- Links silently record `created_by` on creation (not exposed in the UI or API).
- Migration `0007_user_identity.sql` recreates the `settings` table with a `(identity, key)` composite primary key, adds an `identity` column to `api_keys`, and adds `created_by` to `links`.

### Deployment and migration documentation

- Added a prominent warning in the README that GitHub Actions workflows are not copied when Cloudflare forks a repo via the Deploy button.
- Clarified that running database migrations is mandatory: without them the schema is missing and the app will not function.
- Added step-by-step instructions for running migrations manually after each update, and for copying the workflow file into a fork to automate the process.

## 0.13.0

### CF Access auth awareness

- Admin pages (`/_/admin/*`) now validate Cloudflare Access JWTs when the `ACCESS_AUD` environment variable is set.
- Authenticated user email is shown in the sidebar with a logout link.
- `GET /_/admin/logout` clears the Access cookie and redirects to the CF Access logout endpoint.
- When `ACCESS_AUD` is not set the app falls back to trusting CF Access at the network layer (no change for existing deployments).
- No impact on slug resolution, `/_/api/*`, or `/_/mcp`.

### QR code modal

- QR button on the link detail page opens a modal with a large QR image.
- Download buttons in the modal save the code as SVG or PNG.

### Link detail page improvements

- Inline editing for label and expiry directly on the detail page.
- Responsive mobile layout: the three-column hero collapses to a stacked single-column view on narrow screens.

### PWA install

- Settings version card includes an Install App button on supported browsers.

## 0.12.0

### Link creation tracking

- Links record how they were created: `app` (admin UI), `api` (public API), `sdk` (SDK via `X-Client` header), or `mcp` (MCP tool).
- A small badge on the link detail page shows the creation source.
- SDK now sends `X-Client: sdk` on every request so the server can distinguish SDK calls from raw API calls.

### QR code download

- Admin link detail page has a download button in the QR modal that saves the code as a PNG.
- QR codes encode the short URL with a `?qr` suffix so scans are tracked separately from text link clicks.

### QR click channel analytics

- Clicks record whether they came from a QR scan or a direct text link.
- Link detail analytics show a Channels card breaking down QR vs direct clicks.
- Database defaults: existing links get `created_via = 'app'`, existing clicks get `channel = 'direct'`.

### API and SDK

- New endpoint `GET /_/api/links/:id/qr` returns an SVG QR code (optional `?slug` param).
- SDK `getLinkQR(linkId, slug?)` fetches the SVG.
- MCP `get_link_qr` tool returns a base64-encoded SVG for use in AI contexts.

## 0.11.0

### MCP

- MCP landing page and OAuth approval dialog extracted into dedicated modules with shared design tokens.
- MCP OAuth flow verified end-to-end with Claude Desktop, Claude Code, MCP Inspector, and VS Code Copilot.
- Deploy script warns when Cloudflare's "Block AI bots" rule is active, which silently drops MCP connections from AI assistants.
- README documents the required "Block AI bots" disable step as part of MCP setup.

### Admin UI

- Links page uses a hero shorten bar instead of a modal for creating links.
- API Keys page shows an SDK note with npm install instructions.
- Settings page links to release notes for the current version.

### Branding

- SVG logotype and logo assets for light and dark backgrounds, served from `/public/`.
- Admin layout and standalone pages use the theme-aware logotype.
- Removed all inlined SVG markup in favor of `<img>` references to static assets.

### Deploy

- Deploy script resolves both D1 and KV namespace IDs at deploy time. Hardcoded IDs removed from `wrangler.toml`.
- KV namespace created automatically on first deploy.
- Static assets (icons, manifest, robots.txt) moved to `public/` and served by Wrangler directly. Removed hand-rolled asset-serving code.

### Internal

- Standalone page styles split into composable `standaloneBaseStyles` and `standaloneCenteredStyles` exports.
- All dependencies updated.

## 0.10.0

### MCP endpoint moved to OAuth via Cloudflare Access (breaking)

The MCP endpoint at `/_/mcp` now uses OAuth authentication backed by Cloudflare Access for SaaS, replacing API key Bearer tokens. This enables native connectivity from claude.ai custom connectors and other OAuth-capable MCP clients.

**Breaking changes:**

- **API keys no longer accepted on `/_/mcp`.** MCP clients must authenticate through the OAuth flow. Users sign in via Cloudflare Access.
- **New infrastructure requirements.** The Worker needs a KV namespace (`OAUTH_KV`) for OAuth session state, a Durable Object for MCP sessions, and six secrets from the Cloudflare Access for SaaS application.
- **New dependency:** `@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider` handles the OAuth 2.1 protocol.

**Unchanged:**

- API key authentication for `/_/api/*` (SDK and programmatic access) remains the same.
- Admin UI authentication remains external (Cloudflare Access policies, IP rules, etc.).

### Setup requirements

1. Create a SaaS OIDC application in Cloudflare Zero Trust.
2. Set six Worker secrets from the SaaS app: `ACCESS_CLIENT_ID`, `ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET`, `ACCESS_TOKEN_URL`, `ACCESS_AUTHORIZATION_URL`, `ACCESS_JWKS_URL`, `COOKIE_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.
3. Deploy. The KV namespace for OAuth state is created automatically on first deploy. See the MCP section in `README.md`.

## 0.9.0

### Removed Cloudflare Access coupling (breaking)

The app no longer reads or depends on Cloudflare Access JWTs. All CF Access awareness has been stripped from the codebase. Protecting the admin UI is now the deployer's responsibility: use CF Access policies, IP restrictions, Cloudflare Tunnel, or any approach that suits your setup.

**Breaking changes:**

- **API keys are ownerless.** The `email` column is gone. All admin users manage all keys. Existing keys continue to work for authentication.
- **Preferences moved to browser cookies.** Theme and language are stored as `theme` and `lang` cookies. The `user_preferences` table is dropped. Users will need to re-select their theme after upgrading.
- **SDK `AccessTokenAuth` removed.** The SDK only supports `{ apiKey: "sk_..." }` auth. If you used `{ accessToken: "..." }`, switch to an API key.
- **`/_/admin/api/preferences` endpoints removed.** The client now writes cookies directly.
- **`Identity` type and `getIdentity()` removed** from the auth module.

### Migration notes

- Run the new `0004_remove_auth_scoping.sql` migration (applied automatically on deploy).
- Update any CF Access application path if you still want Access protection.
- No changes needed for API key authentication: existing Bearer tokens keep working.

## 0.8.0

### Admin routes moved under `/_/admin/`

All admin pages now live at `/_/admin/*` instead of `/_/*`. This separates the Cloudflare Access protection boundary from the public API path, so API keys work without Access bypass rules.

- Admin pages: `/_/admin/dashboard`, `/_/admin/links`, `/_/admin/keys`, `/_/admin/settings`
- Admin AJAX endpoints: `/_/admin/api/*` (protected by Cloudflare Access at the edge)
- Public API: `/_/api/links/*` (Bearer token only, no JWT)
- MCP: `/_/mcp` (Bearer token only, no JWT)
- Legacy redirects from old `/_/dashboard`, `/_/links`, `/_/keys`, `/_/settings` paths (301)

### Auth model split

The admin UI and public API now use separate auth paths:

- **Admin**: identity extracted from Cloudflare Access JWT via `getIdentity()`. Falls back to "anonymous" when no JWT is present, so the app works without Access configured.
- **Public API/MCP**: `resolveAuth()` checks Bearer token only. No JWT logic.
- Removed `requireAdmin` (dead code). Cloudflare Access handles admin authorization at the edge.

### Identity abstraction

Replaced `getAuthenticatedEmail()` with `getIdentity()` returning `Identity { id, displayName }`. Tries the email claim first, falls back to sub. Decouples the app from email as the sole identity mechanism.

### Cloudflare Access configuration

Update your Access application path from `_/*` to `_/admin/*`. See README for details.

## 0.7.0

### MCP endpoint refactored into the Worker

The MCP server is now a built-in remote endpoint at `/_/mcp`, served directly by the Cloudflare Worker. Every shrtnr deployment includes the MCP server out of the box, authenticated with the same API keys as the admin API.

- Added `/_/mcp` endpoint using Cloudflare's `agents` SDK with `createMcpHandler()`
- MCP tools call the service layer directly for lower latency
- Stateless per-request design: no Durable Objects required
- Consolidated the `mcp/` directory into the main application
- Simplified CI workflows to reflect the single-package structure

### Migration from `@oddbit/shrtnr-mcp`

Replace `npx @oddbit/shrtnr-mcp` with a remote MCP connection to your shrtnr deployment. See the MCP section in `README.md` for client configuration examples.

## 0.4.1

- Deploy script resolves the D1 `database_id` at build time via `wrangler d1 list`, removing the need for a hardcoded ID in `wrangler.toml`
- Works for both the Deploy to Cloudflare button (forks) and Import from Git (existing repos)

## 0.4.0

- Replaced runtime migration system with Cloudflare's standard `wrangler d1 migrations apply` during deploy
- The `deploy` script in `package.json` now runs migrations before deploying, which Cloudflare auto-detects for one-click deploy and Workers Builds
- Migration command references the D1 binding name (`DB`) instead of the database name, so it works regardless of what each user names their database
- Removed `src/migrate.ts`: no application-level migration code runs at request time

## 0.3.4

- Automatic database migrations: the Worker applies pending schema changes on cold start, no CLI commands or dashboard configuration needed
- Compatible with existing deployments: detects migrations already applied by wrangler and skips them
- Reverted deploy command to plain `wrangler deploy` since migrations are now handled at runtime

## 0.3.3
